# Granit — Offsite Backup Device

Custom carrier board for the Raspberry Pi CM4 Compute Module, designed as a minimal offsite backup appliance.

## Concept

A compact, headless device that connects to a remote network and receives encrypted backups onto an attached hard disk.
Designed to be left at a trusted offsite location (friend's house, office, etc.) and managed remotely.

This PCB is designed with [KiCad 10](https://www.kicad.org/blog/2026/03/Version-10.0.0-Released/)

## Hardware

### Core Components

| ASM1061 | PCIe Gen 2 x1 to 2-port SATA III controller (no firmware blob required) |
| 2.5" or 3.5" SATA HDD/SSD | Backup storage |
| Amphenol 10029364-001LF | 22-pin SATA connector (data 7-pin + power 15-pin), right-angle |
| RJ45 + Ethernet magnetics | Gigabit Ethernet |
| DS3231 RTC | Battery-backed real-time clock with alarm wake (I2C) |
| CR2032 coin cell | RTC backup battery |
| RGB LED | Status indicator (idle/backup/error/maintenance) |
| Tactile button | Manual shutdown, trigger backup, enter maintenance mode on boot |
| Hirose DF40C-100DS-0.4V(51) | 2x CM4 board-to-board connectors |
| AP64501SP-13 | 3.5A DC-DC buck converter (reused from [pedalboard-hw](https://github.com/pedalboard/pedalboard-hw)) |

### Key Design Decisions

- **ASM1061 over USB-to-SATA bridges**: Native PCIe SATA controller using the standard Linux
  `ahci` driver. No proprietary firmware blob required — the SPI flash footprint can be left
  unpopulated. SMART works natively (`smartctl /dev/sda`) without SAT translation hacks.
  Both CM4 and CM5 have PCIe Gen 2 x1, so full SATA III throughput is available on either
  module — unlike USB-to-SATA, which would be bottlenecked by CM4's USB 2.0 (~35 MB/s).
- **12V DC input**: Required for 3.5" HDD support (spindle motor needs 12V).
  12V is passed through directly to the SATA power connector.
  AP64501SP-13 accepts 3.8–28V input, so 12V is well within range.
  Both barrel jack (Würth 6941xx301002) and screw terminal (Phoenix MKDS-1,5-2) footprints
  are provided — populate one at assembly time.
- **Reuse from pedalboard-hw**: CM connector, power supply (AP64501SP-13 buck + NCP1117 LDO),
  USB power switch (AP2553W6), KiCad symbol/footprint library, CI pipeline.
- **USB-C OTG**: Single USB-C connector for eMMC flashing (`rpiboot`) and USB mass storage
  gadget mode (initial backup seeding over USB). USB 2.0 device mode only, with USBLC6-2SC6
  ESD protection.
- **SATA power control**: 12V and 5V to the SATA connector are software-controlled via
  GPIO17. HDD is off by default at boot — powered on explicitly by software. Solder jumpers
  (JP5, JP6) allow changing the default to power-on at boot without a PCB respin.
- **Power budget**: 12V @ 2A (3.5" HDD spin-up) + 5V @ 2.3A peak (CM4 + electronics) — use a 12V/3A+ PSU.
- **Boot and storage strategy**: Full OS on CM4 eMMC (no SD card slot), SATA HDD dedicated
  to LUKS-encrypted backup storage only. HDD can spin down when idle. No SD card — eMMC is
  more reliable for a deploy-and-forget device. Reflashing via `nRPIBOOT` + USB-C if needed.

## Software

The device runs Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless).

### Planned Stack

- Restic backup repository (encryption built-in)
- rsync to receive backups from NAS
- `smartmontools` for disk health monitoring (`smartctl /dev/sda`)
- WireGuard VPN for remote management
- RTC-based scheduled wake: DS3231 alarm → GPIO4 interrupt → CM wakes from suspend → backup runs → suspend
  (`GLOBAL_EN` tied high via pull-up, CM4 uses Linux `rtcwake` for suspend/resume.
  Hardware power-off wake via MOSFET latch on `GLOBAL_EN` planned for v2.)
- LUKS full-disk encryption on the backup drive
- Automatic drive mount and health monitoring

### HDD Power Control

GPIO17 (`SATA_PWR_EN`) controls the P-FET power switches for the SATA 12V and 5V rails.
The boot default is selected by solder jumpers JP5 and JP6 (see Design Considerations above).

**Connect sequence** (power on → detect → mount):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Power on SATA rails (GPIO high → N-FET on → P-FET gate low → P-FET on)
gpioset gpiochip0 17=1
sleep 2

# Rescan AHCI bus (ASM1061 hot-plug)
echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan
sleep 3

# Unlock and mount
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 backup
mount /dev/mapper/backup /mnt/backup
```

**Disconnect sequence** (unmount → spin down → power off):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Unmount and close LUKS
umount /mnt/backup
cryptsetup luksClose backup

# Spin down platters
hdparm -Y /dev/sda
sleep 1

# Remove SCSI device before power cut
echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/device/delete

# Power off SATA rails (GPIO low → N-FET off → pull-up → P-FET off)
gpioset gpiochip0 17=0
```

### Deployment

1. Initial backup on-site: connect Granit to local network, run full backup over LAN
2. Move device to offsite location (friend's house, office, etc.)
3. Plug in Ethernet + power — done
4. Subsequent backups are incremental and run automatically over WireGuard

### Monitoring & Alerting

Monitoring must live outside the Granit device — if the device fails, it can't alert about
its own failure. The device reports in after each backup run using a dead man's switch pattern:

- After each successful backup, Granit pings a healthcheck endpoint (e.g. self-hosted or healthchecks.io)
- If the expected ping doesn't arrive, an alert is triggered (email, push notification)
- Reported metrics: backup success/failure, SMART disk health, disk space remaining
- WireGuard connectivity is implicitly monitored — no tunnel means no ping

## Enclosure

Metal enclosure designed for a plug-and-forget deployment. The device should be installable
by a non-technical person: plug in Ethernet, plug in power, done.

### Hammond 1455 Series

Same PCB (92 × 100mm) fits both cases, held by a 3D printed internal frame.
PCB and HDD sit side-by-side along the enclosure length, SATA connector direct-mates between them.

### Requirements

- Cutouts: barrel jack or screw terminal (12V), RJ45 (Ethernet), USB-C
- Tactile button accessible from outside (recessed to prevent accidental press)
- RGB LED visible through enclosure (light pipe or translucent window)
- Thermal pad or heatsink contact for CM4 SoC to enclosure lid
- Internal mounting for 2.5" or 3.5" HDD (M4 mounting holes)
- PCB standoffs (M3 mounting holes)
