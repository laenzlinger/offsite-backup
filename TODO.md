## PCB Layout

Side-by-side layout inside Hammond 1455L2201 (220mm length):

- HDD occupies 147mm, PCB sits in the remaining space
- SATA connector on PCB edge mates directly with HDD
- External connectors (RJ45, USB-C, barrel jack, button) on opposite end panel

Max PCB size: **71 × 99mm** (fits 1455L card guides at 99.5mm — compatible with both cases)

Both PCB and HDD mount independently to the belly plate (slide-out for servicing).

```

Placement rationale:

- ASM1061 near SATA edge → shortest SATA differential pairs
- CM4 center → PCIe north to ASM1061, Ethernet south to RJ45
- RJ45 + USB-C on connector edge → short diff pairs from CM4
- PSU in corner → switching noise away from high-speed signals
- DS3231 + CR2032 → quiet area near CM4 I2C pins
- Button + LED → connector edge, accessible through end plate

### Pre-routing: stackup and impedance (JLCPCB 4-layer)

[JLCPCB JLC04161H-7628 standard 4-layer stackup](https://jlcpcb.com/impedance) (1.6mm):

| Layer | Material | Thickness | Er |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solder mask | — | 0.6mil above trace | 3.8 |
| L1 (Top signal) | Copper | 35µm (1oz) | — |
| Prepreg | 7628 | 0.2104mm | 4.4 |
| L2 (GND plane) | Copper | 35µm (1oz) | — |
| Core | — | 1.065mm | 4.6 |
| L3 (Power plane) | Copper | 35µm (1oz) | — |
| Prepreg | 7628 | 0.2104mm | 4.4 |
| L4 (Bottom signal) | Copper | 35µm (1oz) | — |
| Solder mask | — | 0.6mil above trace | 3.8 |

Trace geometry from [JLCPCB impedance calculator](https://jlcpcb.com/impedance)
(L1 signal, L2 GND reference, 0.2104mm prepreg, Er=4.6, 1oz outer / 0.5oz inner copper):
- 100Ω differential (PCIe, SATA, Ethernet): **0.2205mm trace, 0.2032mm gap**
- 90Ω differential (USB): **0.2860mm trace, 0.2032mm gap**

- [x] Choose fab house: JLCPCB (prototype)
- [x] Update KiCad net classes with calculated values:
  - PCIe: diff_pair_width=0.2205, diff_pair_gap=0.2032
  - SATA: diff_pair_width=0.2205, diff_pair_gap=0.2032
  - Ethernet: diff_pair_width=0.2205, diff_pair_gap=0.2032
  - USB: diff_pair_width=0.2860, diff_pair_gap=0.2032
- [ ] Select impedance control when ordering (+~$10)
- [x] PCB thickness: 1.6mm (standard)

### Checklist

PCB standoff height must match HDD SATA connector vertical position (~3.5mm above belly plate).

- [x] Board outline: 92 × 100mm (fits 1455L slim and 1455T2601 wide cases)
- [x] Verify PCB standoff height aligns SATA connector with HDD receptacle
- [x] 4-layer stackup (signal/GND/power/signal)
- [x] SATA connector: replaced J4+J5 with single 22-pin Amphenol 10029364-001LF (horizontal/right-angle)
  - Footprint: `Connector_SATA_SAS:SATA_Amphenol_10029364-001LF_Horizontal`
  - Symbol: `granit:SATA_22pin`
- [x] External connectors (RJ45, USB-C, barrel jack, button, LED) on opposite edge
- [x] Place CM4 module and all components on top side (facing lid, for thermal contact)
- [x] SATA connector vertical alignment: HDD connector center is 3.50mm above mounting surface (SFF-8301)
  - Use matching standoff height for PCB and HDD (e.g. 5mm) — keeps SATA aligned
  - 5mm standoffs: CR2032 (3.4mm) fits on bottom side ✅
  - 1455L: 5mm + 9.5mm (2.5" HDD) = 14.5mm, 12.5mm to ceiling ✅
  - 1455T: 5mm + 26.1mm (3.5" HDD) = 31.1mm, 17mm to ceiling ✅
- [x] CR2032 holder on bottom side (fits under 5mm standoffs)
- [x] Place ASM1061 near SATA connector (short differential pairs)
- [ ] HDD mounting holes: M4 (4.3mm drill, `MountingHole:MountingHole_4.3mm_M4_Pad_Via`)
- [x] PCB standoff holes: M3 (3.2mm drill, `MountingHole:MountingHole_3.2mm_M3_Pad_Via`)
- [ ] Mounting hole keepout: 7.0mm clearance on pads (prevent screw heads shorting 12V traces)
- [x] Route PCIe differential pairs (100Ω impedance)
- [x] Route SATA differential pairs
- [x] Route Ethernet differential pairs
- [x] Route USB differential pairs
- [x] Power trace width: ≥1.0mm (40 mil) for short branches to pads
- [ ] Power planes on L3: split into 5V and 3.3V zones
- [ ] 12V: copper pour on L4 from barrel jack to SATA power (2A+ spin-up)
- [x] GND: solid plane on L2, stitching vias throughout
- [x] DRC clean (0 violations, 46 justified exclusions)
- [ ] Silkscreen: add labels for switch positions (RUN/BOOT), jumper functions (JP1–JP6), connector pinouts (J8 UART), polarity markings, and board name/revision

## Enclosure

- [x] Case: Hammond 1455T2201 (3.5" HDD) or 1455L2201 (2.5" HDD only)
- [ ] 3D-printed internal frame (slides into case card guide grooves)
  - Holds PCB and HDD at correct height (5mm standoff equivalent)
  - Different frame variants for 2.5" vs 3.5" HDD
  - No belly plate drilling, no standoffs, no CNC needed
- [ ] CNC end plate: cutouts for RJ45, USB-C, barrel jack, button, LED
- [ ] Thermal pad from CM4 SoC to enclosure lid

## Future Improvements

- [ ] TPM/crypto chip (e.g. ATECC608) for secure LUKS key storage (I2C)
- [ ] Evaluate CM5 compatibility (power budget validation)
- [ ] Power LED on fused 12V rail (troubleshooting: PSU present but buck failed)
- [ ] Review fuse rating: 3A may be tight for 3.5" NAS drives (1.8–2.5A spin-up) + CM4 on same rail — consider 4A or inrush limiter
- [ ] Verify ASM1061 exposed pad thermal vias to ground plane (0.5W under sustained SATA III)
- [ ] Read-only root filesystem (overlayfs) to survive power loss — eMMC-only boot has no fallback
- [ ] Second SATA data connector (7-pin) for ASM1061 port B — enables RAID1 or dual-drive backup

## CI/CD

- [x] KiBot artifact generation with KiCad 10
- [x] GitHub Pages deployment (<https://laenzlinger.github.io/granit/>)
- [x] ERC check in KiBot preflight
